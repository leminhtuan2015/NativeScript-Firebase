## Enabling Crash Reporting
Nothing to do - since plugin version 3.4.2 this plugin automatically uploads
crashes to your Firebase Console. Just check the 'Crash' menu item every now and then.

## Making sense of the stacktraces
Please read [the official docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/crash/)
on what Crash reporting is and what you can do to have a better experience.

## Future work
There's an option to send logs to Firebase along with the crash in order
to add some context. This is however currently problematic on iOS but we'll keep an eye out.
